    - name: "Umer Ahmed"
      position: "Sports Interactive, Lead DevOps"
      content: "Mark helped us transition from managing Jenkins as Code as a collection of groovy scripts to Jenkins As Code managed with Ansible. As well as Jenkins builders managed via Ansible. He delivered both projects well on time and assumed end-to-end ownership. Delivered workshops and trainings to handover both projects nicely to the rest of the team"

    - name: "Danny Roberts"
      position: "DJR Tech Limited, Director"
      content: "As Mark worked primarily on security related efforts within Experian we had cause to work together on a number of occasions to ensure the project I was working on was compliant, had good security practises and to share information. "

    - name: "Chris Nelson"
      position: "Mobile Fun Limited, Head of IT"
      content: "Mark is extremely an effective SysAdmin and DevOps engineer. What he doesn't know about building and administering linux systems isn't worth knowing. Projects he worked on when working with me ranged from building and securing linux-based infrastructures (both manually and via puppet manifest control) to firewall configuration and installation in a busy datacentre with minimal downtime and cost to the company. I cannot recommend Mark highly enough for the quality of his work "
